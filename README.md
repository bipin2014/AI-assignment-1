## Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

## AI Perspectives: acting and thinking humanly, acting and thinking rationally 

Thinking rationally — the use of logic. Need to worry about modeling uncertainty and dealing with complexity. Acting humanly — the Turing Test approach. Acting rationally — the study of rational agents: agents that maximize the expected value of their performance measure given what they currently know

## History of AI 
1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.

1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.

1997 - Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.

2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 

2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.

2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. 

## Foundations of AI: Philosophy, Economics, Psycology, Sociology, Linguistics

- Philosophy
  - Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
  - How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
  - Where does knowledge come from?
  - How does knowledge lead to action?

-  Economics
  - How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
  - How should we do this when others may not go along?
  - How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
  
- Psychology
  - the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation
  - the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive internal representations
  - These are in turn retranslated back into action.
 
 - Linguistics
  - How does language relate to thought?
  - Verbal Behavior — behaviorist approach to language learning
  
## Neuroscience, Mathmatics, Computer Science, Control Theory 
  ### Neuroscience:
  Neuroscientists focus on the brain and its impact on behavior and cognitive functions. Not only is neuroscience concerned with the normal functioning     of the nervous system, but also what happens to the nervous system when people have neurological, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
  
  ### Mathmatics:
  Linear Algebra is the primary mathematical computation tool in Artificial Intelligence and in many other areas of Science and Engineering. With this     field, you need to understand 4 primary mathematical objects and their properties:
    
  - Scalars — a single number (can be real or natural).
  - Vectors — a list of numbers, arranged in order. Consider them as points in space with each element representing the coordinate along an axis.
  - Matrices — a 2-D array of numbers where each number is identified by 2 indices.
  - Tensors — an N-D array (N>2) of numbers, arranged on a regular grid with N-axes. Important in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
  - Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues — special vectors and their corresponding scalar quantity. Understand the significance and how to find them.
  - Singular Value Decomposition — factorization of a matrix into 3 matrices. Understand the properties and applications.
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — understand the significance, properties, and applications.  

  ### Computer Science
  Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application. Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.
    
  ### Control Theory
 Control theory deals with a broad variety of problems in a spectrum of devices from speed regulators in the early steam esngines to the team dynamics of those involved in aerospace projects. However, the following problems are unequivocally considered to be difficult within all aspects of conventional control theory:

    1.Optimum control of nonlinear systems.

    2.Optimum control of stochastic systems.

    3.Control of 6DOF multilink manipulators.

    4.Control of redundant systems.

    5.Control of autonomous robots.

    6.Control of systems with multisensor feedback information.

    7.On-line control of systems with incomplete initial knowledge of the model and/or of the environment.

    8.Control of systems under human supervision.
